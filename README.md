StateRouter
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henrytseng/angular-state-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henrytseng/angular-state-router) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/henrytseng/angular-state-router](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/henrytseng/angular-state-router?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) 

An AngularJS state-based router designed for flexibility and ease of use.  

[StateRouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-state-router) is designed to be used in a modular integration with components:

* [StateView](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-state-view)
	* Provides nested view management with template support
* [StateLoadable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-state-loadable)
	* A lightweight and flexible AngularJS lazy loading scheme.

While not required, StateRouter was originally developed with Browserify.  



Installation
------------

To install in your project, simply install from npm 

	npm install angular-state-router --save



Example
-------

[See an example here](http://henrytseng.github.io/angular-state-router).  


Quick Start
-----------

Include the `state-router.min.js` script tag in your `.html`:

	<html ng-app="myApp">
	  <head>
	    <script src="/node_modules/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
	    <script src="/node_modules/angular-state-router/dist/state-router.min.js"></script>
	    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    ...
	  </body>
	</html>

In `app.js` add `angular-state-router` as a dependency when your application module is instantiated.  

And **define** your states and optionally an **default initial location**

	angular.module('myApp', ['angular-state-router']);
	  .config(function($stateProvider) {

	    $stateProvider

	      // Define states
	      .state('landing', {
	        url: '/'
	      })

	      .state('products.listing', {
	        url: '/products', 
	        params: {
	        	catalog: '1b'
	        }
	      })

	      .state('products', {
	        url: '/products/:id'
	      })

	      .state('account', {
	        url: '/account'
	      })

	      // Set initialization location; optionally
	      .init('landing');

	  })
	  
	  .controller('MyController', function($state) {
	  
	  	 // Get the current state
	    var current = $state.current();
	    
	  });



States
------

StateRouter is design for building applications that can be represented with a [finite-state machine model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) (FSM), a computational model.  

States are represented through data objects with an associated dot-notation name.  Child states inherit from parent states by default.  

### Definition

States must be first defined.  This is usually done in the angular **configuration phase** with `$stateProvider` but *can* also be done later with `$state`.   

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .config(function($stateProvider) {
	  
	    $stateProvider
	      .state('account', {
	        url: '/accounts',
	        params: { endpoint: '2998293e' }
	      })
	      
	      .state('account.profile', {
	        url: '/accounts/:id'
	      })
	      
	      .state('account.transactions', {
	        url: '/accounts/:id/transactions',
	        inherit: false
	      });
	  });

Once a state is defined a transition to the state can be made.

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .controller('MyController', function($scope, $state) {

	    $scope.buttonClick = function() {
	    
	      // Update
	      $state.change('products.catalogs.items.variations', { 
	        item: '423', 
	        catalog: 'e534', 
	        variation: '320902'
	      });
	      
	    };
	    
	  });



### Initialization

Initialization occurs automatically when the application is kicked-started.  

`$location.url()` will be checked for an initial location during initialization, if $location.url() has not been set then an alternative default initial location is used if it exists.  

The initialization process is as follows:

1. Configuration Phase
	- Define states
	- Optionally define "initial location"
2. Run Phase
	- Initialization, during application kick-started
	- Initial state set as `$location.url()`, if not empty
	- Initial state falls back to "initial location"

An initialization `$stateInit` event is broadcasted on `$rootScope`.  

To listen to the init event:

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .controller('MyController', function($rootScope) {
	  
	    $rootScope.$on('$stateInit', function() {
	    
	    	// Responding code
	    
	    });
	  
	  });



### Usage

After states are defined a transition can be made

	// Change state
	$state.change('account.profile', { employee: 'e92792-2389' });

State changes are *asynchronous* operations.  

Current states can be checked using the `active` method which accepts a state notation query

	<li ng-class="{'active': $state.active('company') }"><a href="#" sref="company">Company</a></li>

And in the same method a state can be triggered using the `sref` attribute.  

	<a href="#" sref="company">Company</a>

Parameters can be sent similarly

	<a href="#" sref="company({id:'Lorem ipsum'})">Company</a>



### Inheritance

States inherit from each other through a parent-child relationship by default; where `campus` is the parent of `campus.classrooms` state.  

A child state will inherit from it's each of its parents until a `inherit` value of `false` value is encountered.  

For example, given this definition

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .config(function($stateProvider) {
	  
	    $stateProvider
	      .state('campus', {
	        url: '/campus',
	        params: { availability: false }
	      })
	      
	      .state('campus.classrooms', {
	        url: '/campus/rms/:id',
	        params: { size: 30 }
	      });

	  });

We see that `campus.classrooms` will have a `params` value

	{ 
	  availability: false,
	  size: 30
	}

Where `availability` is inherited from `campus`, its parent



Resolve
-------

States that include a resolve property will resolve all promises and store results in the `locals` Object, where they can be accessed `$state.current().locals`.  

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .config(function($stateProvider) {
	  
	    $stateProvider
	      .state('stories', {
	        url: '/storyteller/stories',
	        
	        resolve: {
	          story: function(StoryService) {
	            return StoryService.get();
	          }
	
	        }
	      });
	  })
	  .controller('StoryController', function($state) {
	    console.log($state.current().locals);
	  });
	
`locals` is has with the following value at the completion of the state transition:
	
	{
	  story: 'Lorem ipsum'
	}



Actions
-------

States that include an action property will execute additional actions before a .  

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .config(function($stateProvider) {
	  
	    $stateProvider
	      .state('auth.logout', {
	        url: '/logout',
           actions: [
             function(Auth, $state) {
               Auth.logout().then(function() {
                 $state.change('landing');
               });
             }
           ]
	      });
	  });
	
States may often require additional actions to be performed during transition.  These actions typically do not expose data like `resolve` property but may execute other services.  



Events
------

Events are broadcast on the `$rootScope`.  


### $stateInit

This event is emitted when $state is initialized.  If an initial state is specified `$stateInit` occurs after the current state is set.  



### $stateChangeBegin

* `request` *Object* Requested data `{ name: 'nextState', params: {} }`

This event is emitted when a requested change to a valid state exists.  



### $stateChangeError

* `request` *Object* Requested data `{ name: 'nextState', params: {} }`

This event is emitted whenever an error occurs.  



### $stateResolveBegin

This event is broadcasted when the processing of the `resolve` property starts.  



### $stateResolveEnd

This event is broadcasted when the processing of the `resolve` property ends.  



### $stateResolveError

This event is broadcasted when an error occurs while resolve properties are processed.  



### $stateActionBegin

This event is broadcasted when the processing of actions start.  



### $stateActionEnd

This event is broadcasted when the processing of actions end.  



### $stateActionError

This event is broadcasted when an error occurs while actions are processed.  



### $stateChangeErrorNotFound

* `request` *Object* Requested data `{ name: 'nextState', params: {} }`

This event is emitted when a state cannot be found and no parent state(s) exist.  



### $stateChangeEnd

* `request` *Object* Requested data `{ name: 'nextState', params: {} }`

This event occurs when a valid state change successfully finishes.  This event does not trigger when an error was encountered.  Use the `'change'` event for all change requests.  



### $stateReload

This event is broadcasted when the current state is reloaded.  



### $stateChangeComplete

* `error`   *Object* Null if successful, `Error` object if error occurs
* `request` *Object* Requested data `{ name: 'nextState', params: {} }`

This event occurs when a state change is finished.  This event is always triggered on any change request.  Also occurs *after* 'error' is emitted.

API Directives
--------------

### sref

* sref {String} A defined state to transition to, using state name notation

Request a state transition when clicked.

##### Example
	
A state transition to `products.items` with parameters `{catalog:'1-aeff', item:'e32537'}`
	
	<a sref="products.items({catalog:'1-aeff', item:'e32537'})">Product</a>



State Notation
--------------

States use dot-notation where state names are `/[a-zA-Z0-9_]*/` strings separated by dots `.` and are case sensitive.  

The following are examples of valid unique state names:

	ochestra1.trombone.position.6
	ochestra1.clarinet
	ochestra56.clarinet
	ochestra1


### Parameters

Data Objects can be included in an expression (not query) given by Object literal notation.  Using name-value pairs of Boolean/Number/String/null.

They are expressed using parenthesis `()` surrounding the Object literal at the end of a state expression.  

	ochestra1.trombone.position.6({id:'49829f', color:329, custom:true})


### Queries

The following are examples of state notation queries that would match the state `ochestra1.trombone.position.6`

	ochestra1
	ochestra1.trombone
	ochestra1.trombone.position
	ochestra1.trombone.position.6


### Wildcards

Queries can also use wildcards `*` to match any one state or `**` to match any pattern of states following or preceding.  

Both of the following will match the state `catalog.index.list`

	catalog.*.list
	catalog.**


### Current State

Use a single `.` to represent the current state.  



URLs
----

URLs in state definitions take the form:

	$stateProvider.state('events.details', {
	  url: '/events/:eventid',
	    params: {
	      eventid: 'init'
	    }
	  })

Where parameters are specified in URLs using variable names starting with a colon, e.g. - `:id`.  And a default value can be specified using a `params` Object.  

To retrieve the current state and its parameter values use (e.g. - for example finding the value of `eventid`):

	$state.current().params.eventid


### Query String

Query string values are also set in the params object.  

Given the URL `http://test.com/#/events/birthday_event?color=blue`

	assert(params).equal({
		eventid: 'birthday_event',
		color: 'blue'
	});



Components
----------

Components register themselves as middleware layers and respond to state changes.  

* [StateView](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-state-view)
* [StateLoadable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-state-loadable)

### Building a Custom Component

To build your own components simply register your the middleware with the `$state.$use()` method.  

`$use` expects a function signature `function(request, next)` where `request` is data Object containing data for the current state transition and `next` is a completion callback.  

	angular.module('myComponent', ['angular-state-router'])

	  .factory(function($state) {

	    // Register middleware layer
	    $state.$use(function(request, next) {
	    
	      // ... Perform work
	    
	      // Asynchronous completion
	      next();

	    });

	  });

Component operate asynchronously and `next` must be called.  


Browserify
----------

To use Browserify `require` the module directly.  

For convenience use:

	var app = angular.module('myApp', [
		require("angular-state-router")
	]);

You can also separate the dependencies of your application for quicker packaging.  We suggest the following, in a separate `lib.js` file which does not have to be rebuilt frequently add:

	// AngularJS
	require('angular');
	
	// Dependencies
	require("angular-state-router");

Then you can use the module in your application, `app.js`

	var app = angular.module('adminApp', [
	  "angular-state-router"
	]);
