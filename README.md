[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/henrytseng/angular-state-router.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/henrytseng/angular-state-router)

StateRouter is an AngularJS state-based router designed for flexibility and ease of use.  

StateRouter is designed to be used in a modular integration with:

* StateView
	* A view rendering engine
* StateLoadable
	* A lazy loading scheme

While not required, StateRouter was originally developed with Browserify.  



Install
-------

To install in your project, simply install from NPM 

	npm install angular-state-router --save



Quick Start
-----------

Include the `state-router.min.js` script tag in your `.html`:

	<html ng-app="myApp">
	  <head>
	    <script src="/node_modules/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
	    <script src="/node_modules/angular-state-router/dist/state-router.min.js"></script>
	    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    ...
	  </body>
	</html>

Add StateRouter as a dependency when your application module is instantiated

	angular.module('myApp', ['angular-state-router']);

Then **define** your states and **initialize** StateRouter

	angular.module('myApp')
	  .run(function($stateRouter) {

	    $stateRouter

	      // Define states
	      .state('landing', {
	        url: '/'
	      })

	      .state('products.listing', {
	        url: '/products'
	      })

	      .state('products', {
	        url: '/products/:id'
	      })

	      .state('account', {
	        url: '/account'
	      })

	      // Initialization
	      .init('landing');

	  });



State Notation
--------------

States use dot-notation where state names are `[a-zA-Z0-9]*` strings separated by dots `.`

The following are examples of valid state definitions:

	ochestra1.trombone.position.6

### Queries

The following are examples of state notation queries that would match

	ochestra1.trombone

### Wildcards

Queries can also use wildcards `*` to match any one state or `**` to match any pattern of states following or preceding.  

Both of the following will match the state `catalog.index.list`

	catalog.*.list
	catalog.**



Running Tests
-------------

To run tests 

	npm install
	gulp test
